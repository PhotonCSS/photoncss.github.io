# Shadow
In material design, everything should have a certain z-depth that determines how far raised or close to the page the element is.

## Shadow classes
You can add the class `raised-{0-24}` to any item to give it a shadow. The number represents the elevation in dp. There are also:

* `raised-{0-24}`
* `raised-hover-{0-24}`
* `raised-focus-{0-24}`
* `raised-active-{0-24}`

### Example
```html
<div class="raised-2 raised-hover-4 raised-active-8">Raised Element</div>
```
