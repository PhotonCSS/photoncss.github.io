### Blazing Fast
Photon now tracks what elements need to be changed using an HTML attribute. Only processing what it has to, Photon is ultra-efficient and performs very well on everything from toasters & microwaves, to NASA supercomputers.

### Developer Focused
Dive right in with whatever your comfortable with. If you're a React developer, install the react components. If not, just reference the scripts and stylesheets like usual.

### Responsive
Adapting to all screen sizes, Photon will look and feel exactly the way your users would expect it to if it was installed on their device.
